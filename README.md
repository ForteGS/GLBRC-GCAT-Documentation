<h1>GLBRC-GCAT Documentation</h1>
	
<p>This repository tracks the progess of documenting GCAT's code. </p>
<p>The actual implementation for the program and web server is in the trunk folder.</p>
<h2> Several words about GCAT </h2>
<p>GCAT is a web-based tool for summarizing microbial growth curves using mathematical modeling. The user interface requires no programming and calls on an R package of the same name which processes input data files, models the curves, calculates important growth parameters from the fits, and returns both graphical and tabular output. </p>

<p>Some features of GCAT are still being worked on. </p>
 		
<p>The documentation mostly focus on clarifying how the goodness of fit and the proportion of the reached plataeu are computed. </p>

<p>Instruction for the reading order:</p>
<ol>
<li> Fitted.well.odt: Read the first 4 bullets. </li>
<li> Read NormlizeAndTransform.odt </li> 
<li> Read Prefitted And Fit Model Data.odt </li>
<li> Read slopeAnalysis.odt and WellObjectAndFuntionality.odt for clarification of fitting model procedure. </li>
<li> Finish Fitted.well.odt. </li>
<li> Read GoodnessOfFit.odt and ProportionOfThePlateauReached.odt</li>

The file SumGCATDoc.odt contains the compiled version of all the documentation above.
