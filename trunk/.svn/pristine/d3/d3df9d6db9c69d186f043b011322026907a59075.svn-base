\title{Main output function for GCAT}
\description{
This is the main function that handles all the output for analyzed data files. 
It is called by the top level function \code{\link{gcat.analysis.main}} along with \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.
}
\usage{
gcat.output.main(fitted.well.array, out.prefix = "", source.file.list, upload.timestamp = NULL, add.constant, blank.value,
start.index, growth.cutoff, points.to.remove, remove.jumps, out.dir = getwd(), graphic.dir = paste(out.dir, "/pics", sep = ""), 
overview.jpgs = T, unlog = T, silent = T)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fitted.well.array}{
An array of fitted \code{well} objects (see \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}) 
}
  \item{out.prefix}{
The output files will all be named using this prefix. Usually some derivative of the source file names. 
}
  \item{source.file.list}{
List of source files used in analysis. Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{upload.timestamp}{
Formatted timestamp at the time of upload. Added to the output file names. 
}
  \item{add.constant}{
The value for n in the log(OD + n) transformation used by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{blank.value}{
Blank OD measurement for uninoculated wells by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{start.index}{
Timepoint used as the first one after inoculation by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{growth.cutoff}{
Threshold used to decide whether a well displayed growth by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{points.to.remove}{
A vector of integers specifying which timepoints should be removed
across all wells by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{remove.jumps}{
Whether jumps in OD detected by the subfunction \code{check.slopes} were removed by \code{\link{gcat.fit.main}}.  Added to the end of the tabular output only as a comment. 
}
  \item{out.dir}{
Name a directory to which GCAT will export text results.
Defaults to working directory.
}
  \item{graphic.dir}{
Name a directory to which GCAT will export graphics results.
Defaults to a "pics" subdirectory of \code{out.dir}.
Note: directories will be created if not existant.
}
  \item{overview.jpgs}{
Whether a .jpg graphic should be exported for each plate in the array depicting an overview graphic
See GCAT documentation for a description of all graphics. 
}
  \item{unlog}{
Should entries be transformed back to the numeric scale before exporting?
}
  \item{silent}{
Should all messages returned to the R console
(by this function and its sub-functions) be suppressed?
}
}
\value{
A list of full paths to files generated by R.
