***   Note for the GCAT meeting: Thu 5/29/2014   ***

Enhancement for GCAT 4. (After done with this it's gonna be GCAT 5)

1. Biphasic curve: 
               _____
              /
             /
        ____/
      /
     /
    /
___/

normal curve:
        _____
       /
      /
     /
    /
___/

2. Extract background values for each time point doing the average value of 3 background wells.
Question: So the original GCAT only extracts background values in each well for time point 0? And we are asked to implement an options that extract background values for each time point?

3. Implement option to subtract an average of control wells at each time point.

4. Accomodate a possibility of having temperature in the second column of the input.

5. Accept FluoStar's input. Currently GCAT has a different input format. Input format migh need to be more flexible. Many people are using different system. <rather complicate> 

6. heatmaps be comparable between each runs. Give the users an option to manually set the heatmap range.

7. Get the area under the curve between an specified range of time. Give the users an option to manually set the range to calculate the area under the curve.
Question: Evaporation? 

8. Some people don't understand the error messages from R. Get a log error for GCAT so that these errors can be reported to GLBRC. ==> Put supporting messages after printing out the error message.

9. Implement option that graphs like the glucose consumption, ethanol production.
Example's graph:

g/l
_____
     \
      \
       \
        \
         \
          \_____
                 t


Priority:
1. Heatmap
2. Compute the area of the curve. 
3. 



*** DOCUMENTATION for GCAT code ***

Need to clarify what is x and y in the GoodnessOfFit.odt.
Make things more clear.
